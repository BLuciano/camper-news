Free Code Camp challenge. 
Building a site that display recent news posted on the camper news at Free Code Camp. Grabs information from API.

While building this site I wanted to add some complexity to the original challenge by creating a filter. The filter would be used to sort the given news in different categories (date, upvotes and name). In order to do so I stored the data gathered from the API into an array of objects. Each object contained different keys in correlation to the filters I wanted to use. Whenever the user presses a filter, the array is sorted using the fiter as a key. 
This added challenge helped me learn some new techniques for data storage and manipualtion. Also, it remarked the importance of seeing the project as a whole and how to visualize the required tasks individually before tackling them.
